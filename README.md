Click on the plus sign to add a new note. Enter a text in the textbox. The textbox closes when you click outside it. To re-enable it and edit an existing note click on the text of an existing note.

Click on the trash can of an existing note to delete it. 

Organise your notes by adding tags. You add tags by simply adding a hash sign (`#`) in front of any word in the note. Filter your collection by entering tag name in the search field at the top or by clicking on tags in your existing notes.
